<title>Instructions for Retrieving Work from WrittenKitten.net</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>- <strong>Option #1</strong> - safest:</p>
<p>Determine what browser you were using
  when your work was being saved.</p>
<p>	- If Firefox, the text is stored here: C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME HERE\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\WHATEVER
  FOLDER IS THERE\webappsstore.sqlite - that file will most likely be huge,
  so I recommend you download the free trial of <a href="http://www.pilotedit.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=section&layout=blog&id=8&Itemid=56">PilotEdit</a>, a program that is
  especially good at opening big text files, and use it to open the file. Then
  do a search for some line from your work and copy and paste it out of there.</p>
<p>- If Chrome, the text is stored here: C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME HERE\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User
Data\Default\Local Storage\ and it will look something like http_writtenkitten.net_0.localstorage</p>
<p>- If IE, Opera, or Safari - I don't know, so proceed to option #2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- <strong>Option #2</strong></p>
<p>I cannot guarantee that this will work, but it's
  really your only option other than digging around your computer trying to find
  out where the text was stored to retrieve work that was saved locally from
  writtenkitten.net right now.</p>
<p>- On Windows, get into File Explorer and go to:<br />
  c:\Windows\system64\drivers\etc\ - or c:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc if you
    have a 32 bit Windows installation (you probably don't...) - if you don't
    know how to get into File Explorer, it's just that thing that you see after
    you click Computer or Documents or whatever where you can see folders and
    files. It kind of looks like a miniature web browser, but is only used for
    finding files and folders on your local computer.</p>
<p>- Double-click the file called &quot;hosts&quot; and then choose Notepad from
  the options given to you to open the file.</p>
<p>- Enter the following to the bottom of the file:</p>
<p>168.144.38.35 www.writtenkitten.net<br />
</p>
<p>168.144.38.35 writtenkitten.net</p>
<p>- Make sure that the space between .35 and the URL's is a tab space instead
  of four individual spaces.</p>
<p>- Click File and then Save or hold down CTRL and click S on your keyboard.</p>
<p>- Open the browser that you were using to work on your work last. Put writtenkitten.net
  into the URL bar and then click the arrow (or enter on your keyboard). Hopefully
  your work will show up on screen and you can copy it and paste it out of there
  into something more permanent.</p>
