# ABOUT

This is the source code for http://writtenkitten.co/, provided for the interest of anyone who'd like to know how it works, or adapt it for their own use.

The website and the code are provided "as is". Current plans for the next version are:

1) Add the optional ability to have multiple tabs (multiple stories)

2) Add an optional simple login system a' la Reddit that allows the saving of stories to a database.

3) Design a Written Kitten t-shirt and link to it.

4) Make the app "more" responsive so that it is confirmed that it looks good on tablets. I doubt very many people are typing away on their phones, but iPads and Kindles have keyboard attachments now.

If you want to send me something awesome that you've built to add in I will consider it. Simplicity is the important thing. This web app is popular because it's easy to understand.
